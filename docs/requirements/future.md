#### HACC Team Management
There is potential for HACC Hui to improve the HACC experience after team formation, and perhaps even replace DevPost.  Teams need to fill out forms, teams need to submit things by certain deadlines, and HACC Hui can help with this process. However, I suggest we cross that bridge after the Team Formation issue has been addressed.
