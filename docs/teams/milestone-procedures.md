title: Typical Milestone Flow
sidebar_label: 414 Milestone Flow
---

At the start of each milestone each team will fork the [HACC-Hui repository](https://github.com/HACC-Hui/HACC-Hui) into their team's organization. Then you can set up your project board for the milestone adding issues for each of the User Stories for the milestone. You can add any additional issues to help you accomplish the user story. Assign the issues to a team member. Create branches for each issue. Once you finish the work merge the issue branch back into the main branch.

You will present your team's solution to the class. I will choose the best implementation. The chosen team will create a pull request to merge their solution into the HACC-Hui repository. Then the process starts again for the next milestone.
